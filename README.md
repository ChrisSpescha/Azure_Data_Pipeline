Azure Data Pipeline
This repository contains the code and configuration files for an Azure Data Pipeline.

Overview
The Azure Data Pipeline is designed to move data from various sources into a centralized data repository for analysis and reporting. The pipeline is composed of several Azure services, including Azure Data Factory, Azure Databricks, and Azure Blob Storage.

The pipeline consists of the following steps:

Data ingestion: Data is collected from various sources, such as FTP servers, APIs, and databases.
Data transformation: The data is then transformed and cleansed using Azure Databricks.
Data storage: The transformed data is stored in Azure Blob Storage.
Data processing: The data is processed using Azure Databricks and other Azure services, such as Azure SQL Database, Azure HDInsight, and Azure Machine Learning.
Data visualization: The processed data is then visualized using Power BI or other reporting tools.
Requirements
To deploy the Azure Data Pipeline, you will need the following:

An Azure subscription with the necessary permissions to create and configure Azure services.
Azure Data Factory and Azure Databricks instances.
An Azure Blob Storage account for storing data.
Deployment
To deploy the Azure Data Pipeline, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Create a new Azure Data Factory instance and link it to this repository.
Create an Azure Databricks workspace and configure it to use the same storage account as the Azure Blob Storage.
Create an Azure Blob Storage account for storing data.
Update the configuration files in the repository with your own credentials and connection strings.
Publish the pipeline and trigger it to start processing data.


An integrated data analytics environment makes it easier to create and automate data pipelines and workflows to deliver information to business users. It reduces data silos, enhances security and governance, and eliminates system redundancies
